Automated Web App Deployment: CI/CD with Kubernetes and Docker
==============================================================

**PROJECT OVERVIEW:**

                            Muthukumar, under the expert guidance of AR Shankar from Valaxy Technologies, successfully executed a comprehensive web application deployment project. This initiative incorporated robust version control through GitHub, Maven for streamlined building processes, and a powerful Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline orchestrated by Jenkins. The application was deployed on a virtual machine using Tomcat. In addition to the core technologies, Docker was employed for efficient containerization, while Ansible played a pivotal role in configuration management. The deployment strategy was seamlessly executed with Kubernetes, showcasing a forward-looking approach to modern application deployment practices. The successful collaboration and integration of these technologies underscore the project's commitment to industry best practices and cutting-edge solutions in the realm of web application deployment.
